As people are so used to targeted reading, we feel reluctant to read faced with large textual 
data. The social movement records are buried in the dust of history. How to preserve these 
stories and present them to people in the original style has become our focus. Our group used 
the NLTK toolkit in python to analyse textual data and used quantitative data as evidence to 
guide and support our reading in the complete dataset. We combine our findings and present 
an interactive digital newspaper to break down the barrier for the public to get an overview of 
the 19th century Spiritualist Newspaper. Through the coursework we unpacked how 
visualization techniques can help humanity studies and deepened our understanding of the 
visualization process.

## Encyclopedia Britannica (2021)
<img width="1124" alt="datafair-2022-britannica" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1230497/188271821-2a6794ff-4a10-4354-9df2-56c93a175e3f.png">

Our project is an interactive projection installation of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Since 
we got datasets from the National Library of Scotland, and found that it has 8 editions of 
195 volumes, which is difficult for people to find information they need. For the sake of 
enhancing the Encyclopaedia Britannica’s readability, interactivity and enjoyment, we try 
to find specific relationships in it and use creative methods to immerse audiences in 
reading.

## Green Light Electric Vehicle (2021)

<img width="1435" alt="datafair-2022-LEV" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1230497/188271507-c0df9ffd-5d70-453a-ad26-74ab1e2383f4.png">

This project is situated in the context of Germany’s emission reduction targets. IT analyses the changes in Germany’s overall carbon emissions and 
those of the transport sector. It also compares data about Light Electric Vehicles (LEV) and traditional fuel vehicle (TFL) to create an interactive comic website and to order to offer more information about the difference in those two types of vehicles. The interactive comic aims to raise the environment protection awareness of users who want to buy a car and motivate them to buy LEV vehicle, which will increase the transport sector's role in 
reducing emissions.

## La Goccia Urban Forest in Milan (I) (2021)

<img width="1322" alt="datafair-2022-milano" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1230497/188271173-790ae6c1-0734-4d52-b2f4-765b1b2846b7.png">

Our group analysed tree data and geographic information in an urban forest in one part of Milan. The tree data was visualized through geographical modeling of the areas involved and by abstracting multiple trees from the plot site into a single tree. We built a physical model of the site with trees visualizing those data captured about the specific area in the urban forrest: tree species, growth rate, diameter, biodiversity, etc.

## La Goccia Urban Forest in Milan (II) (2021)

<img width="927" alt="datafair-2022-lagoccia-22" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1230497/188271679-8f9730d5-ceb7-45fe-9252-d9e9d27b92bb.png">

La Goccia, located in Milan between the Bovisa and Villapizzone districts, known as 
the gas meter zone, is a hidden place filled with more than 2,000 precious trees. 
Decades ago, this vast expanse of green space was occupied by defunct factories, 
which have been waiting since ancient times to repair pollutants produced by 
industry. The data supporting this project was collected from part of a project called "As 
Infrastructure (https://treesasinfrastructure.com/). 

In this project, we have chosen to reach more local citizens and use the 
website as a powerful way to reawaken their awareness of the many values of trees 
in a relaxed and enjoyable way.

## Cultural Maps (2019)
<img src="images/cultural-maps.png" width="100%">

Our study seeks to create a cultural map for tourists or locals in the City of Edinburgh that encompasses both the main cultural assets available and incorporates additional aspects such as demographic information, ethnicity and religious organisations, monuments and open spaces. A key challenge was to present (in a digestible way) what is an extremely rich dataset with enough depth to maintain the integrity of relationships but that could span the entire city to allow deep insights across different areas.

To experience the nodes that form the cultural sites in a human way, we therefore struck on the idea of using the transport network - the main arteries that help people travel through the city - as a way to effectively slice through and expose the depths of the dataset. Selecting a particular Lothian bus route (#16), we analysed religious, demographic data and cultural sites with proximity to bus stops along that line. This enables us to transcend the city and delve into the various flavours and influences appearing in very different but quite localised areas.

<img src="images/scrapbooks-2.png" width="100%">

Edwin Morgan was the first national poet in Scotland, and he wrote many influential poems in his life. In addition to the poems he left to the public, he also produced 12 scrapbooks during his entire life and these scrapbooks are valuable biographical materials for people to learn more about Morgan and the time he lived. the metadata about the scrapbooks was collected and our project is to utilize the metadata to visualize the scrapbooks and allow the public to know what are in the scrapbooks without viewing the original books. The data we have for the project are 4 of overall scrapbooks that were produced from the 1930s to 1960s.

## Cancer Data (2019)

<img src="images/cancer-data.png" width="100%">

This project is a data visualization project on cancer data in England. In this project, researchers analyzed data from Simulacrum, gained insights into cancer incidence, mortality rates, etc. Eventually, the project designed data visualizations to deliver these insights. The design outcome involves a data comics and paper engineering.

Traditional paper engineering works such as pop-up cards and books us the element of surprise to delight and amaze audiences at all age levels. Pop-up books could be printed in large numbers using cheap materials.

## Spriritualist Newspapers (2019)
<img src="images/spiritualists.png" width="100%">

Spiritualism is a religious movement started in the half of the nineteenth century and based on the belief that “human’s consciousness survives corporeal death by maintaining a transcendent existence in a spirit world” (Valente, 2008). It started in New York in 1848, spreading to British in the 1850s and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-speaking countries(Braude,2001). In 1969, the newspaper titled “ the spiritualist” was published in London and issued in other countries in the next 13 years.

Methods of Natural Language processing are used to conduct data analysis and the analyzed result will be visualized in the form of data comic.

## Scottish Witchcraft (2018)
<img src="images/witchcraft.png" width="100%">

This project is about understanding and visualising the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database. The database is a documentation of all known information about accused witches and the witchcraft belief in Scotland between 1563 and 1736 (The University of Edinburgh, n.d.). The database is a Microsoft Access database owned by the School of History, Classics and Archaeology of the University of Edinburgh.

Our group created a physicalisation which is an interactive physical map and objects that audiences can interact with. The piece aims to educate audiences with the history of the Scottish witchcraft including the general distribution of accused witches by gender and location as well as the different torture types by location. Our audiences can be anyone that is interested in the Scottish Witchcraft history.

## Visualising NHS Scotland Patient Care Experiences (2018)
![](images/nhs.png)
This project created an interactive visualisation that allows the user to explore differences in patient experiences across Scotland. The Scottish government collects data on healthcare experiences through a biannual survey, but they typically publish this data in lengthy reports and large tables, making it difficult for laypeople as well as policymakers to use the data. In our project, we tried to make this data more accessible by creating visualisations.

## Utilising FIFA Data to Visualise Team Formations (2018)

![](images/fifa.png)
The aim of this project is to analyse FIFA World Cup 2018 Qualifiers data and provide useful insights via data visualisations. We implemented this project by developing a web platform that allows users (soccer experts, managers, scouts, etc.) to generate customised visualisations in order to understand the data and extract non-trivial information. The idea behind our implementation is to produce clean and easy to follow plots that can be potentially used by the soccer domain experts to make analyses of opponents’ playing styles, formations, strengths and weaknesses, etc. 

The main page of the visualisation displays a high-level overview of the data, using glyphs to symbolise inequality — the less round, the more difference in the reported experiences of patients. Clicking the glyphs takes the user to a heatmap displaying the reported experiences for overall themes and optionally for individual survey questions. This setup allows the user to control how much detail is being shown.
